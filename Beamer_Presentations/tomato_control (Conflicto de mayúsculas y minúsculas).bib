abstract = {Indian tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) (Geminiviridae: Sub-group III) was detected both in field-collected and laboratory-reared B. tabaci using a triple-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TAS-ELISA). ToLCV was detected in six of the 10 group samples of field collected B. tabaci. ToLCV was also identified in 13 weed species commonly found in Karnataka, both by symptom expression and TAS-ELISA. ToLCV from c. 61{\%} of infected plants was transmitted successfully to tomato by B. tabaci. Tomato plots were planted at three locations on the University of Agricultural Sciences Campus, Bangalore. Indian tomato leaf curl virus disease (ToLCVD) incidence increased most rapidly when the tomato plot was situated adjacent to an older ToLCVD-infected tomato field. When the plots were positioned in a dryland or a wetland area, at least 500 m away from any infected tomato fields, the ToLCVD incidence increased less rapidly, although in all sites it was 100{\%} by 11 wk after transplanting. The numbers of B. tabaci caught on yellow traps in all sites increased during weeks 1-3 after transplanting and thereafter remained at between 10-15 adults trap-1 24 h-1. Adult numbers recorded on tomato plants by direct counts remained approximately constant at 2-4 adults plant. Tomato fields were planted in three taluks (administrative areas) of Karnataka, that had different current and previous histories of tomato production. ToLCVD incidence increased most and least rapidly, respectively, in Kolar taluk where tomato is grown continuously and Doddaballapur tuluk where tomato was grown in the area for the first time. In Malur tuluk, where tomato was grown discontinuously (once a year), the incidence of ToLCVD increased at an intermediate rate. Weed host-plant species growing near the experimental sites had averages of between 1.5-10.0 B. tabaci nymphs per plant, whereas the tomato plants had only 0.3 nymphs per plant. The percentage parasitism of B. tabaci nymphs on tomato and weed species, respectively, was 0.7{\%} and 2-6{\%}. Nymphs and pupae were parasitised by an Encarsia sp. and Eretmocerus mundus Mercet. The relevance and implications of these findings for the epidemiology and management of ToLCVD in Karnataka State, South India is discussed.},

@article{Shun-xiang2001a,
abstract = {Abstract Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) has been considered as a serious pest in all of tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. B. tabaci first recorded as early as in 1940s in China and has been reported as a pest of various crops in 22 provinces or cities. But only recently it has become a severe problem for vegetable and ornamental crops in Guangdong and Beijing. In China B. tabaci is known to transmit at least 5 plant viruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl virus (TomLCV), squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV-C). So far, approximately 18 parasitoids, 17 predators and 1 pathogenic fungus were recorded in China. This paper presents an overview of B. tabaci as a pest and virus vector in China, with special attention given to non-chemical control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley. All rights reserved.},

@article{Holt1999,
abstract = {1. A number of insect vectors of plant-virus diseases make only transitory visits to the crop in which the economic effects of the disease are important. The incidence of disease in the crop depends primarily on the immigration of vectors from alternative hosts which act as a reservoir of both the virus and vector. 2. An epidemiological model was developed to represent this situation and parameters were estimated for the case of tomato leaf curl virus disease (TLCVD) (Geminiviridae, Subgroup III) in India. From an analysis of the model, the following possibilities for the management of TLCVD emerged. 3. It was clear that varietal resistance to infection could be an important component of disease management but whether, once infected, the tomato plants acted as a source of inoculum had little impact on disease incidence in the tomato crop. 4. A very low rate of simulated vector immigration into a tomato crop sufficed to cause almost total infection. Around Bangalore, vectors may migrate into tomato crops in numbers in excess of those required for disease 'saturation', explaining why, using conventional insecticides, very efficient and intensive vector control is currently required to reduce disease incidence. 5. Disease incidence was sensitive to vector mortality only when vector numbers were low. In most cases, the immigration of viruliferous vectors made disease incidence insensitive to the mortality of vectors within the tomato crop. 6. A strategy for disease management which targets more than one of the parameters to which the model proved most sensitive is likely to be necessary. In particular, the use of protective netting combined with the growing of resistant varieties has the potential to reduce both B. tabaci immigration to the crop and to reduce virus inoculation by those insects which do reach the crop.},

@article{Jeger2009a,
abstract = {We have developed a generic modelling framework to understand the dynamics of foliar pathogen and biocontrol agent (BCA) populations in order to predict the likelihood of successful biocontrol in relation to the mechanisms involved. The model considers biocontrol systems for foliar pathogens only and, although it is most applicable to fungal BCA systems, does not address a specific biocontrol system. Four biocontrol mechanisms (competition, antibiosis, mycoparasitism and induced resistance) were included within the model rubric. Because of the wide range of mechanisms involved we use Trichoderma/Botrytis as an exemplar system. Qualitative analysis of the model showed that the rates of a BCA colonising diseased and/or healthy plant tissues and the time that the BCA remains active are two of the more important factors in determining the final outcome of a biocontrol system. Further evaluation of the model indicated that the dynamic path to the steady-state population levels also depends critically on other parameters such as the host-pathogen infection rate. In principle, the model can be extended to include other potential mechanisms, including spatio-temporal heterogeneity, fungicide effects, non-fungal BCA and strategies for BCA application, although with a cost in model tractability and ease of interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Fishpool1995a,
abstract = {Population phenologies of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), in young cassava crops in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, West Africa, are described for three field seasons. Populations of all stages were consistently greatest 6–12 weeks after the crop was planted. The number of adults on plants as well as on attractive and non-attractive sticky traps displayed cycles of buildup and decline each year, the periodicity of these cycles corresponding to the generation time of B. tabaci under field conditions. Adult population declines were probably caused by emigration from the crop. Rainfall was negatively correlated with both nymph and adult populations, possibly due to reduced oviposition after rain. B. tabaci is the vector of African cassava mosaic geminiviruses (ACMV) and the observed B. tabaci population trends fit well with the pattern of ACMV buildup in the crop. {\textcopyright} 1995, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Plant viruses are an important constraint to crop production worldwide. Rarely have plant virologists, vector entomologists and crop specialists worked together in search of sustainable management practices for viral diseases. Historically, modelling approaches have been vector-based dealing with empirical forecasting systems or simulation of vector population dynamics. More recently, epidemiological models, such as those used in human/animal epidemiology, have been introduced in an attempt to characterize and analyse the population ecology of viral diseases. The theoretical bases for these models and their use in evaluating control strategies in terms of the interactions between host, virus and vector are considered here. Vector activity and behaviour, especially in relation to virus transmission, are important determinants of the rate and extent of epidemic development. The applicability and flexibility of these models are illustrated by reference to specific case studies, including the increasing importance of whitefly-transmitted viruses. Some outstanding research and methodological issues are considered.},
